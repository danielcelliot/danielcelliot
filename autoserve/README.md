# AutoServe

This website was a semester project for a Distributed Systems Progamming course that I took, as part of my Software Engineering programme at UTT. I was tasked with designing and creating both the frontend and backend for an auto-mechanic business, with the following requirements:

- Attract young professionals and the more high-end segment of the market. The website must reflect the level of professionalism expected by these customers
- Clients would be able to log into the site and view the status of current jobs, but also the history of the work done on their vehicle at AutoServe. Clients should also be able to use an estimate calculator on the site to have an idea what it would cost would be to do a particular set of work e.g. change oil and filters, check belts, tune up, clean injectors etc.
- Staff should be able to register new customers and their vehicles, create jobs and assign a mechanic to be principally responsible for a job. Each job should have an associated invoice detailing what was done and the cost.
- Offer basic auto accessories for sale. These items should also be advertised along with their prices on the website. Purchases however are made at the garage.
