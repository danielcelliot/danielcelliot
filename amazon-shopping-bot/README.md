# Amazon Shopping Bot

A command-line shopping bot built using Selenium and .NET Framework. This bot was created to monitor the availabilty of Next-Generation video game consoles (in 2020), and automatically purchase the consoles as soon as they came in stock.

The covid pandemic and lockdowns caused severe supply chain issues, including a chip shortage. Many electronic products were in very high demand during this time, especially Sony's PlayStation 5, which in its first wave of sales, was sold out in less than 30 minutes at all major online ecommerce sites (Amazon, Walmart, Target). Traffic to websites during this period was so high, that it lead to major outlets (Walmart) becoming unresponsive.

Through sheer persistence and long hours, I managed to secure one PS5 for myself, by refreshing my web browser every few minutes to check for availability, and patiently waiting for alerts on social media.

I thought it would be a good opportunity to purchase more, but only if I could automate the process. So I spent 2 evenings researching how bots work and the technologies that I could use to create one. Another 3 evenings I spent on coding this bot, using .NET framework and Selenium web driver.

Using a command-line interface, you enter your account credentials (Amazon, Newegg or BH Photo & Video) and the bot takes care of the rest. The bot will run in the background and check for item availibility. Once the item is in stock, the bot would automatically enter the checkout flow and purchase the product.

Using the bot, I was able to purchase 2 additional PlayStation 5's through amazon. Considering their high demand, low supply and what customers were willing to pay, I was able to resell them at 300% markup.
