# ICT Lab Scheduler

This application was a semester project for a Software Engineering Internship course that I took, as part of my Software Engineering programme at UTT.

I was tasked with investigating the current scheduling and reservations of ICT labs handled by staff members at UTT. Upon the result of the investigation, I would then design and implement a new data management system.

The existing system implemented by the Information and Communication Technology department of UTT, is a File Cabinet System for the disposal of labs to the teachers.
The Discipline coordinators will submit the time tables for every semester to the overall ICT administrator. The administrator then decides which courses require labs (ensuring that there are no double-bookings), the capacity of the lab and the software that will be utilized. The formulated information is printed and stored in a file cabinet, and a copy is handed out to the respected teachers.
In case of a makeup class or any teacher wishing to use the labs, they would contact the ICT admin.

The following were taken into consideration:

- The capacity of each lab.
- How many computers each lab contained and their working state of each.
- The software installed on each computer
- If the lab contained an overhead projector or not.
- The booking times: 8am- 12noon, 1 pm â€“ 4pm and 5pm to 9 pm.

Based on the requirements of the business, cost and time-constraints, a database built using Microsoft Access, posed to be best suited.
