# About Me

This website was an assignment for a User Interface Design course that I took, as part of my Software Engineering programme at UTT. I was tasked with coding and designing a website that gave some information about myself, with a focus on a visually appealing design and clear visual hierarchy.

CSS Grid gained widespread browser adoption around 2017 and for this course (2018) I was excited to try and build something interesting with it, but with a modern design that would not look out-of-place on a real portfolio website, for example. This was also my first timme using CSS @keyframe animations as well.

Timeframe: 2 weeks

Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS3 (no libraries or CSS frameworks used)
- Javascript (no libraries used)
