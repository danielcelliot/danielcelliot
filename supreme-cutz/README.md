# Supreme Cutz

This application was a group semester project for a Software Engineering Internship course that I took, as part of my Software Engineering programme at UTT. The application was created for a Barbershop use-case.

Supreme Cutz caters to mostly walk-in appointments and occasionally take appointments by phone. This frequently leads to the barbershop being overcrowded which leads to some customers not even being able to get a haircut in the first place.

We designed a website for Supreme Cutz that will boost efficiency and organization when it comes day to day business. Appointments can be made for a specific barber in order to reduce confusion when a client enters the barbershop. With this appointment regime, there wonâ€™t be overcrowding in the barbershop therefore adhering to the Covid-19 guidelines which have been recently established by the Ministry of Health.
