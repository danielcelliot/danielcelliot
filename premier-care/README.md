# Premier Care

This application was a group semester project for a Business Programming course that I took, as part of my Software Engineering programme at UTT. The application was created for a Hospital use-case and needed to accommodate the following requirements:

- Storing patient details, including their name, address, DOB, allergies, blood type, etc. Each patient will have a unique patient number.
- A patient can make an appointment to see a doctor on staff. The appointment contains patient information, doctor information, date, time and particulars for the appointment, including which CSR made the appointment.
- There are also several nurses, lab and x-ray technicians and therapists on staff whose details need to be recorded.
- There are six general categories of services a patient may use: pediatrics, general practice, specialist, laboratory, therapy, and x-ray. Each services has a different unit cost
- Each patient may be required to take a variety of drugs, a certain number of times per day, and for varying lengths of time. Each drug has a cost associated with it.
- The system will also need to track a patientâ€™s treatment and it should be capable of calculating the cost of treatment In order to provide itemized billing.
- A billing invoice will be generated every visit for the services a customer has used. It provides a detailed list of all services used during the visit
